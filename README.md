1. Controllers<br>
Scripts that controlls our GameObjects
<br>

2. SceneManagers<br>
Scripts that controlls scene traversing
<br>

3. Statics <br>
Scripts that are not inherited from MonoBehaviour <br>


## To-Do<br>
1. Store NPCs details (as they will act differently as the evil we become)
2. Fix response flag as per the npc number (prevention of too many if else cases)
