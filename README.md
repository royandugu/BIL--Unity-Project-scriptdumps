1. Controllers<br>
Scripts that controlls our GameObjects
<br>

2. SceneManagers<br>
Scripts that controlls scene traversing
<br>

3. Statics <br>
Scripts that are not inherited from MonoBehaviour <br>


## To-Do<br>

1. Same JSON file for all NPCs and use of dynamic classes (reflection) to fetch the 
    individual NPCs. How can we do it? By names.

2. Store NPCs details (as they will act differently as the evil we become)
3. Fix response flag as per the npc number (prevention of too many if else cases)
