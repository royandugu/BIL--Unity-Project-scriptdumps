1. Controllers<br>
Scripts that controlls our GameObjects
<br>

2. SceneManagers<br>
Scripts that controlls scene traversing
<br>

3. Statics <br>
Scripts that are not inherited from MonoBehaviour <br>


## To-Do<br>
1. Revert back to previous commit
2. Individual JSON files for individual NPCs. 
3. Store NPCs details (as they will act differently as the evil we become)
4. Fix response flag as per the npc number (prevention of too many if else cases)
