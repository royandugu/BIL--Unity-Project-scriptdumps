1. Controllers<br>
Scripts that controlls our GameObjects
<br>

2. SceneManagers<br>
Scripts that controlls scene traversing
<br>

3. Statics <br>
Scripts that are not inherited from MonoBehaviour <br>


## To-Do<br>
1. Fetching one values at a time has been fixed. All it is left is to fix some code reusability. Hint : Use Inheritance?? 
2. Store NPCs details (as they will act differently as the evil we become)
